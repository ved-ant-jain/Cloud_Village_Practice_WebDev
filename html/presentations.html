                <p>Abstract<br>The Bug Hunter's Methodology (TBHM) is a series of talks done by Jason exposing new advents in tools, tactics, and procedures used in web pentesting, bug bounty, and red teaming. In this talk, Jason will explore the mindset of approaching a hardened web target and how he breaks up finding vulnerabilities across its' stack. Many talks can teach you how to exploit a certain vulnerability, less can teach you how to find out where they are in complex pieces of software. TBHM also covers Jason's personal tips/tricks in the areas of automation, content discovery, javascript analysis, spidering, parameter analysis, functionality ""heatmapping"", and more. The DEF CON edition will not be recorded and will release some free cutting edge content usually only available in Jasons live courses!</p>
