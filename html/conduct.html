            <h1>5. Reporting Guidelines</h1>
            <h6>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a village organizer as soon as possible.

            <h6>This Code of Conduct applies to all participants at the event, including hackers, volunteers, organizers, and anyone with an official role in the village. The policies also apply at all related social events and in digital spaces associated with the village.</h6>
            <h1>7. Liability of Information Disclosure</h1>
            <h6>All discussions, presentations, and content presented within the village are the responsibility of the individual presenters or speakers. It is the duty of each presenter or speaker to ensure they have undergone the appropriate responsible disclosure processes and obtained all necessary consents for the information they disclose. Presenters and speakers are solely liable for ensuring that they are authorized to share any discussed material. The village organizers, staff, or DEF CON are not responsible for unauthorized disclosures by presenters or speakers.</h6>
